# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-Verilog

##Introduction
This Verilog project implements a T-intersection traffic lights controller, a critical component of modern traffic management systems. The controller regulates the flow of traffic at a T-intersection by coordinating the timing of traffic lights for different directions. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionality, and how to use or modify it.
